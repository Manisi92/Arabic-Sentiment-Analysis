# Arabic Sentiment Analysis Tool
Overview

This project implements a sentiment analysis tool for Arabic text, designed to classify text as having a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. It can be used for a variety of applications, such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and product reviews, particularly relevant for businesses in the UAE that handle a lot of Arabic content.
Features

    Pre-trained Arabic transformer model (AraBERT) fine-tuned for sentiment analysis.
    Arabic text preprocessing and tokenization.
    Sentiment classification into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral.
    API service built using Flask to handle real-time sentiment analysis requests.

Technologies Used

    Python 3.8+
    Hugging Face Transformers for pre-trained models (e.g., AraBERT).
    Flask for creating a web service API.
    PyTorch for model training and inference.
    Camel Tools for Arabic text tokenization.
    scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib for data processing and visualization.

Installation
Requirements

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

    Python 3.8 or higher.

    Install required dependencies using the following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Command Line Interface

You can use the tool via the command line to analyze the sentiment of Arabic text. To do this, use the following command:

python src/predict.py "أنت رائع"

This will output the sentiment classification of the provided Arabic sentence (e.g., "Positive", "Negative", or "Neutral").
Web Service

To run the sentiment analysis tool as a web service, use the Flask app:

    Start the Flask web server:

python src/app.py

The server will be running at http://localhost:5000. You can send a POST request to /predict with the following JSON body:

{
  "text": "أنت رائع"
}

The response will contain the sentiment prediction:

    {
      "sentiment": "Positive"
    }

Steps for Building the Project
Step 1: Setup Environment

    Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv sentiment-env

Activate the environment:

    On Windows:

sentiment-env\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

    source sentiment-env/bin/activate

Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing

    Find a dataset containing labeled Arabic text for sentiment analysis (e.g., AraSenTi or Twitter Sentiment dataset).
    Preprocess the data using the preprocess_data.py script to clean and tokenize the Arabic text. This script removes unwanted characters and prepares the text for model training.

Step 3: Model Training

    Fine-tune a pre-trained model like AraBERT for sentiment classification on your dataset.
    Use the script train_model.py to train the model and save the trained model to disk.

Step 4: Prediction Script

The predict.py script uses the fine-tuned model to predict sentiment for a given Arabic text. The script loads the trained model and tokenizer, tokenizes the input text, and returns the sentiment class (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).
Step 5: Deploy as a Web Service

    Flask web service: The app.py script creates a simple web API that listens for POST requests at /predict. It returns a sentiment classification for the input text.

    Start the server:

    python src/app.py

    The API is accessible at http://localhost:5000.

Example

Here’s an example of how to use the API:

    Request:

    Send a POST request to http://localhost:5000/predict with the following JSON body:

{
  "text": "الشمس مشرقة"
}

Response:

The server will respond with the sentiment classification:

    {
      "sentiment": "Neutral"
    }

Optional Enhancements

    Multilingual Support: Extend the tool to support sentiment analysis in other languages (e.g., English, Urdu).
    Advanced Metrics: Add a dashboard to visualize metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
    Web Scraping for Data: Scrape Arabic text from sources like Twitter or news sites and use them to improve the model.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Arabic text for sentiment analysis. The tool can be integrated into various applications such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and more. By using pre-trained models like AraBERT and creating a simple Flask-based API, you can deploy this tool for real-time sentiment analysis.
